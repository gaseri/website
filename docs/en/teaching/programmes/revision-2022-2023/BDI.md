It is expected that after successfully fulfilling all the obligations stipulated in the program, the student will be able to:

O1. Choose distributed architectures for working with big data (eg lambda, kappa, delta, etc.) and appropriate tools for such architectures.  
O2. Anticipate the needs of an intelligent information system for the infrastructure in the cloud with the connection to appropriate interfaces of data, information and knowledge repositories with associated metadata.  
O3. Design a model of data management, coordination, message exchange, and interaction in an intelligent information system using appropriate methods and techniques (e.g. distributed databases, cache systems, message exchange systems, data streaming systems, etc.) and a corresponding distributed database model using appropriate languages ​​for data modeling and taking into account the specifics of the system architecture.  
O4. Recommend technologies for implementing the integration of data, information and knowledge from heterogeneous and distributed data systems that meet the requirements of the given problem.  
O5. Choose an appropriate set of cloud technologies (eg monolithic and microservice architectures, containers, virtual machines, etc.) for the implementation of an intelligent information system.  
O6. Develop intelligent cloud services based on data analytics and artificial intelligence, as well as related interfaces and appropriate documentation.

### Comments

Teaching will be conducted by combining work in the classroom and independent work outside the classroom, with the use of an e-learning system.

### Student responsibilities

Responsibilities of students in the course are:

- Regularly attending classes, participating in all course activities, and monitoring notifications related to classes in the e-learning system.
- Take continuous knowledge assesments (theoretical and practical colloquiums) and successfully pass them.
- Create practical works (individual or team projects) on given topics and defend them.
- Take the final exam and score at least 50% on it.

### Assessment of learning outcomes in class and at the final exam (procedure and examples)

- A written or online test in which the student will demonstrate the understanding and the ability to analyze and synthesize theoretical concepts of distributed systems, heterogeneous data systems, architectures for working with large-scale data, infrastructure of intelligent information systems, and cloud technologies (I1, I2, I4, I5) .
- Experimental work with different architectures for working with big data and appropriate tools (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, HBase, etc.) with the aim of collecting analytical metrics necessary for predicting infrastructure needs of an intelligent information system based on that architecture (I1, I2). In accordance with the provided infrastructure, the student will design a model of data management, coordination, message exchange, and interaction and also recommend technologies for the implementation of a heterogeneous and distributed data system (such as distributed relational and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, databases based on data streaming (e.g. Kafka), blockchain technologies and/or generalized databases, document-based databases, and media and object-oriented databases) (I3, I4).
- Practical work defended orally in which the student will choose an appropriate set of cloud technologies (such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Scaleway, DigitalOcean, Watson, Wit.ai, Botpress, etc.) and use it for the development of an intelligent service (e.g. an intelligent agent or an intelligent information system component) based on data analytics and artificial intelligence and also associated interfaces (e.g. REST, WebSocket, TCP/UDP, ZMTP, AMQP, XMPP, etc.), with appropriate documentation (I5, I6, I8). As part of the development, they will also implement procedures for automated testing of the cloud service using appropriate technologies (e.g. unit testing, end-to-end testing, penetration testing, ethical hacking, etc.) (I7).

### Quality monitoring methods that ensure the acquisition of exit knowledge, skills and competences

Periodical evaluations will be carried out in order to ensure and continuously improve the quality of the course and the study programme (as part of the activities of the Quality Assurance Committee of the Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies). In the last week of classes, students will anonymously evaluate the quality of the course. An analysis of student success in the course will also be carried out (percentage of students who successfully completed the course and their grade average).

[^1]: **Important:** Enter the appropriate proportion of ECTS credits for each activity so that the total number of credits equals the ECTS value of the course. Use empty fields for additional activities.
