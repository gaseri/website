## Course description

### Course objectives

The human genome project began in the 1990s to identify and sequence all human genes. As early as the early 2000s, a large amount of data on genes encoding proteins was publicly available for research. These data and the information derived from them, the availability of ever faster supercomputers, and the advancement of methods used in computational biochemistry and biophysics in the next two decades enabled the rapid development of a branch of molecular biology called structural biology, which links the structure and function of biological macromolecules proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes.

The objective of the course is to acquire knowledge about data structures and algorithms that form the basis of modern software in the field of computational biochemistry and biophysics and the possibilities of application and procedures for further development of existing software by scientific research needs. There is a specific focus on data structures and algorithms that enable the execution of this software on exascalar supercomputers. The objective of the course is also to get acquainted with current scientific research issues in this area and approaches that answer these questions.

### Assessment of learning outcomes in class and at the final exam (procedure and examples)

Learning outcomes are assessed through scientific research in which the student applies theoretical and practical knowledge of the subject. The student should describe the results of the research in a seminar paper, which can also be written in the form of a scientific paper. In this way, the seminar paper can serve as the basis for the publication of a scientific paper that will be published at a conference or in a journal in consultation with the course instructor and the student's mentor.
