# Dr. Vedran Miletić, principal investigator

> "Ideas are organic entities," someone has said. The very fact of their birth endows them with form, and that form is action. He in whose brain the most ideas are born accomplishes the most. From that cause a genius, chained to an official desk, must die or go mad, just as it often happens that a man of powerful constitution, and at the same time of sedentary life and simple habits, dies of an apoplectic stroke.
>
> Passions are naught but ideas in their first development; they are an attribute of the youth of the heart, and foolish is he who thinks that he will be agitated by them all his life. Many quiet rivers begin their course as noisy waterfalls, and there is not a single stream which will leap or foam throughout its way to the sea. That quietness, however, is frequently the sign of great, though latent, strength. The fulness and depth of feelings and thoughts do not admit of frenzied outbursts.

## Research

### Present research

The focus of my research work is heterogeneous, parallel, and [distributed computing](https://hazelcast.com/glossary/distributed-computing/) on [high performance computers](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/high-performance-computing/what-is-hpc/) and in the cloud for [computational chemistry](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/careers/chemical-sciences/fields/computational-chemistry.html) applications. Presently, I am collaborating with [Martina Ašenbrener Katić](https://portal.uniri.hr/Portfelj/987) on research of distributed chemical compound database architectures that meet the scalability and reliability requirements of high-throughput virtual screening campaigns.

### Past research

I was a postdoctoral researcher in professor [Frauke Gräter](https://www.h-its.org/people/prof-dr-frauke-grater/)'s [Molecular Biomechanics (MBM)](https://www.h-its.org/research/mbm/) [group](https://www.h-its.org/research/mbm/people/) at [Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS)](https://www.h-its.org/). I was researching efficient ways to simulate breaking and formation of [disulfide bonds in proteins](https://www.h-its.org/projects/mechanobiochemistry/) as well as participating in development of [free](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) and [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) software we used. Our developments [can be found on GitHub](https://hits-mbm.github.io/).

I was also a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of professor [Mario Radovan](https://fidit-rijeka.github.io/mario-radovan/) at [University of Rijeka](https://uniri.hr/) [Department of Informatics](https://www.inf.uniri.hr/). I collaborated with assistant professor [Željko Svedružić](https://svedruziclab.github.io/principal-investigator.html)'s [Biomolecular Structure and Function (BioSF)](https://svedruziclab.github.io/) [Group](https://svedruziclab.github.io/group.html) at [Department of Biotechnology](https://www.inf.uniri.hr/). I was studying [molecular modelling of biomolecules](https://svedruziclab.github.io/research.html). I was concentrated on investigating reaction dynamics of [protein–ligand interactions](https://svedruziclab.github.io/software.html#autodock-and-autodock-vina) with [molecular](https://svedruziclab.github.io/software.html#gromacs) [dynamics](../tutorials/gromacs/index.md) and nudged elastic band methods using [quantum](https://svedruziclab.github.io/software.html#cp2k) [chemistry](https://svedruziclab.github.io/software.html#nwchem) and QM/MM approaches.

I have done my PhD work under the supervision of professor [Branko Mikac](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/branko.mikac) (retd.) at [University of Zagreb](http://www.unizg.hr/) [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/) [Department of Telecommunications](https://tel.fer.hr/ztel). My PhD research work has been focused on evaluation of [optical telecommunication network reliability](https://integraoptics.com/whats-up-network-reliability/) and availability using [Monte Carlo method](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MonteCarloMethod.html) and optimization of [routing and wavelength assignment](https://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/RWA.pdf). Additionally, I was focused on parallel execution of [network simulation](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3227076/network-simulation-or-emulation.html) software.

## Development

I am leading the development of [RxDock](https://rxdock.gitlab.io/), a fork of [rDock](https://rdock.gitlab.io/) protein–ligand docking software developed at [RxTx Research](https://rxtxresearch.github.io/) (in collaboration with [Patrik Nikolić](https://nikoli.ch/)). (Feel free to [contact me](https://vedran.miletic.net/#contact) if you want to contribute to the project in any way.)

I am developing [extensions and modifications](https://hits-mbm.github.io/) of [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/) molecular dynamics simulator in a number of different directions, but all designed with [upstreaming](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/dev-manual/contribute.html) in mind. Among others, I'm working on [sliced pull and conditional stop](https://github.com/HITS-MBM/gromacs-developments). (Feel free to [contact me](https://vedran.miletic.net/#contact) with any questions or ideas.)

I was one of the developers of [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) network simulator. In particular, I was a developer of [optical telecommunication network model](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Optical_network_models) called [Photonic WDM Network Simulator (PWNS)](../../hr/istrazivanje-i-razvoj.md#fotonicki-wdm-mrezni-simulator-photonic-wdm-network-simulator-pwns) ([source code available on request](https://vedran.miletic.net/#contact); detailed description of the feature functionality is available in [my PhD thesis](#books-and-theses)).

Among other projects, I have contributed patches to [LLVM](https://www.llvm.org/) and [Mesa](https://www.mesa3d.org/) (part of [Radeon open source Linux driver development](../../hr/aktivizam/index.md#razvoj-upravljackih-programa-otvorenog-koda-za-graficke-procesore-amd-radeon) effort), [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/), [LaTeX Beamer class](https://www.ctan.org/author/miletic), and others (detailed summary of my contributions can be found on [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/vedranmiletic)). Prior to contributing code to open source projects, I was a tester and web standards advocate for [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) and also tester and support for [kX Project](https://github.com/kxproject), an alternative driver for [Sound Blaster Live!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_Live!) and [Audigy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_Audigy) cards developed to expand the potential of the [EMU10kX](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Soundblasterlive1024_4closeup.png) DSPs.

I follow the development of tools such as [NEPI/NEF/NETNS](http://yans.pl.sophia.inria.fr/trac/nepi/), [IMUNES](http://www.imunes.tel.fer.hr/)/[CORE](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/ncs/products/core), [OpenFlow](https://opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/customer-case-studies/openflow/), [NDN](https://github.com/named-data), [CUB](https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/), [Modern GPU](https://github.com/moderngpu/moderngpu/wiki), [NVBIO](https://nvlabs.github.io/nvbio/), and [UGENE](https://ugene.net/).

## Activism

I am a member of the Committee for [Supercomputing Resources at University of Rijeka](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/members/) that is directing the activities of [Centre for Advanced Computing and Modelling (CNRM)](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/) and supporting the users of [the Bura supercomputer](https://cnrm.uniri.hr/hr/bura/).

As a coordinator of the local Linux user group (LUG) [HULK Rijeka](https://www.ri.linux.hr/), I regularly advocate for the usage and development of free and open source software (FOSS). In particular, we are organizing the observances of [Document Freedom Day](https://freedomday.github.io/document/) on a regular basis, where we promote the usage of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), an [open source](https://opensource.org/osd) office suite, and [OpenDocument](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/), an open standard format for office documents.

Finally, I stand for individual freedom which is constantly under threat from pervasive surveillance and unrestrained authoritarian governments. I appreciate and support the work of [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) in this area.

        GROMACS now compiles on Solaris x86, specifically illumos distribution
        openindiana. GCC complained about a missing sqrt() variant which was
        addressed with static_cast and linker complained about missing
        libsocket which was addressed with SunOS-specific entry in
        target_link_libraries.

    ??? note
        It's possible to use -deffnm in restarts even if it wasn't used in
        the initial simulation. This can lead to absurd situations such as:

        Expected output files not present or named differently:
          pullx.xvg
          pullf.xvg

        where pullx.xvg and pullf.xvg are present and named exactly as listed,
        but GROMACS expects them to be named as -deffnm requested.

        The improved error message suggest to the user to check for that
        possibility.

    ??? note
        Commit aa905d6 attempted to enable avx512 on GCC 4.9 or newer and
        Clang 3.9 or newer, but had elseif() in place of else() and resulted
        in no SIMD being enabled.

        This patch really enables avx512 on supported compilers, and takes
        care of all compilers we officially support (MSVC, GCC, Clang, ICC).

    ??? note
        Enabling avx512 requires GCC 4.9 or newer or Clang 3.9 or newer. Since
        we support compilers older than those, we can not afford to enable
        avx512 in own fftw unconditionally.

    ??? note
        B-factor values will be added to residues unless an index is larger
        than the number of residues or an option is specified. Protein residue
        indices can start from any number and, in case they start from a large
        number, there is no way to add B-factor values to residues.

        This patch changes it to add B-factor values to residues unless the
        number of B-factor values is larger than the number of residues.

    ??? note
        The device name from the vendor could contain anything, and we need to
        avoid dot and slash when we try to make a filename from it. To help
        keep it valid for all possible users, we permit only alphanumeric
        characters from the current locale.

    ??? note
        If building an OpenCL kernel fails, we still want to let the user know
        why the build process failed. Therefore the code has to write the build
        log prior to throwing a build failure exception.

    ??? note
        Static function qualifiers are supported since OpenCL 1.2. When Mesa 3D
        Gallium Clover state tracker is used on AMD Radeon GCN cards, it only
        provides OpenCL 1.1 support, so static function qualifiers are not
        supoorted.

    ??? note
        Installation of gromacs creates 2 symlinks for libgromacs.so, which become
        broken once library is removed. During uninstall, CMake macro EXISTS will follow
        symlink and conclude files do not have to be removed.

    ??? note
        Directory lib was used as library directory for tng_io library. This
        causes problems on Debian wheezy (and future versions), which expect
        libraries to be installed under lib/&lt;arch&gt;. GROMACS already uses
        ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR} for libgromacs.so, and this patch makes
        libtng_io and libtng_compress install in the same location.

        This was also addressed in the TNG repository and this commit
        corresponds to commit e8fa7bf3abfc74acf60a048cdfe1f65fdbc0dc2d in
        the TNG repository.

        This patch also bumps minimum CMake version required for building
        tng_io from 2.8 to 2.8.8 due to inclusion of GNUInstallDirs module.

    ??? note
        This patch adds PCI IDs for:

        * TerraTec DMX XFire 1024
        * Hercules Gamesurround Fortissimo II
        * Hercules Gamesurround Fortissimo III 7.1

        All those cards were supported as generic CS46xx device,
        so they will work as before. I'm pretty sure that first two
        cards work, as they have same hardware design as reference
        card. Not sure about Fortissimo III, but this won't break it
        if it worked.

        Tested on TerraTec DMX XFire 1024.

    ??? note
        Even though MIDI was fixed on ice1724 chips a while ago, it wasn't yet
        enabled for some cards as it didn't get enough testing. This was tested
        with MIDI keyboard on PHASE 22 and with looping back output to input and
        it works stable, so it's safe to enable it.

        Besides this, there are some more minor fixes, not exactly user visible:

        * added info about PHASE 28 (collected, as I don't have a card)
        * added info about TS22PCI and new revisions of PHASE 22
        * disable 192k on PHASE 22 as AK4524 I2S doesn't support it

    ??? note
        Structs are currently handled as pointer + byval, which makes AMDGPU
        LLVM backend generate incorrect code when structs are used. This patch
        changes struct argument to be handled directly and without flattening,
        which Clover (Mesa 3D Gallium OpenCL state tracker) will be able to
        handle. Flattening would expand the struct to individual elements and
        pass each as a separate argument, which Clover can not
        handle. Furthermore, such expansion does not fit the OpenCL
        programming model which requires to explicitely specify each argument
        index, size and memory location.

    ??? note
        Diagnostics should note version dependent issues by giving
        a hint about current version being compiled for.

        This patch changes diagnostics of static storage class specifier
        and generic type qualifier to specify OpenCL version as well as
        converts other diagnostics to match the style.

    ??? note
        Presently errors from frontend are handled only if they occur in
        clang::CompilerInvocation::CreateFromArgs(). This patch uses
        clang::DiagnosticsEngine to detect errors such as invalid values for
        Clang frontend arguments.

    ??? note
        OpenCL apps can quote arguments they pass to the OpenCL compiler, most
        commonly include paths containing spaces.

        If the Clang OpenCL compiler was called via a shell, the shell would
        split the arguments with respect to to quotes and then remove quotes
        before passing the arguments to the compiler. Since we call Clang as a
        library, we have to split the argument with respect to quotes and then
        remove quotes before passing the arguments.

        v2: move to tokenize(), remove throwing of CL_INVALID_COMPILER_OPTIONS

- commit [`f781366d2e484edbad34c52f74d48482ad0e2f32`](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/commit/f781366d2e484edbad34c52f74d48482ad0e2f32): Fix compilation with Clang 3.2 and newer versions, including Apple Clang 5.0

    ??? note
        Clang 3.2 requires all class members to be used in the code; this patch either removes class members that are not used or adds NS_UNUSED/NS_UNUSED_GLOBAL around them. Thanks to Andrey Mazo and Tommaso Pecorella for review.

    ??? note
        Clang identifies as GCC 4.2 to compilers which check for GCC version. This patch adds further check for clang and undefines __DEPRECATED macro in case Clang is detected. Newer versions of Clang are much stricter and still require CXXFLAGS for other warnings.

    ??? note
        This is a massive upgrade removing almost all pre-waf 1.6 script code. In addition, this does away with custom pkgconfig.py script for making .pc files and replaces it with waf's builtin mechanism.

        Massive thanks to Alex Afanasyev for ideas and bugfixing, to Alina Quereilhac for bugfixing and testing, and to Tom Henderson for thorough testing.

    ??? note
        Summary:
        `system-ui` is provided by modern browsers as [a cross-platform default font](https://caniuse.com/font-family-system-ui). Using this font [was a controversial choice back in 2017](https://infinnie.github.io/blog/2017/systemui.html). because it did not address i18n well and therefore it was removed from Bootstrap [twbs/bootstrap#22377](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/22377). However, it was added back in Bootstrap v5 [twbs/bootstrap#30561](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30561) since it got better over time.

        Fixes T15049.

        Test Plan: Tested locally for now.

    ??? note
        Added Tabularize command for easy conversion to CSV using CLI.

        Added Transform command that replaces a number of Perl scripts used
        for sorting, naming, and filtering with the goal to eventually replace
        all presently bundled Perl and Python scripts.

        The public API should be considered work in progress at this point. At
        the time of the stable release, the public API will support a number
        of operations and will remain stable over time as the internal program
        structure continues to change.

        Thanks to Sergio Ruiz Carmona <Sergio.RuizCarmona@baker.edu.au> for

    ??? note
        Updated logos and documentation accordingly. Versioning changes:

        - Removed EXEVERSION which was wrong anyway since we haven't used
           CVS $Id$ values since forking.
        - Removed IDS_BUILD which we didn't use and it ain't going to work in
            the future if we want to support reproducible builds.
        - Restarted versioning from 0.1.0 since the plan is to use semantic
            versioning from now on. Removed separate include/VERSION and
            integrated into RbtResources.h which will eventually be generated
            by Meson at build time.

        Cleaned up inconsistent use of tabs and spaces and replaced old style
        string formatting (%) with new style (.format()). Used autopep8 for
        further PEP 8-compliant style fixes.

        Open Babel 3 puts pybabel module inside openbabel, so import has been
        changed to try that first and fall back to 2.x style import if the first
        import fails.

    ??? note
        In addition, ran perltidy on the scripts and removed a duplicate of the
        header in sdmodify.

    ??? note
        To make the change less distruptive, RowMajor order is still used, but
        the array indexing is now from 0 instead of 1, which simplifies the
        code quite a bit. Built-in Eigen functions are used where possible.

- commit [`5506d9531cef068cbcfb28c5cb7bd43eaf9105e5`](https://gitlab.com/rxdock/rxdock/-/commit/5506d9531cef068cbcfb28c5cb7bd43eaf9105e5): Replaced Nelder-Mead implemenation

    ??? note
        Nelder-Mead implementation used previously was previously built on top
        of TNT. Since the usage of TNT was replaced by Eigen, it's reasonable
        to use Eigen for Nelder-Mead as well. Thanks for the implementation
        guidance go to Matthieu Brucher: <http://blog.audio-tk.com/>

        Partial credit goes to Dominik Kinkela <dominikkinkela@gmail.com> for
        the experimentation regarding the implementation approach.

    ??? note
        - missing include guards
        - new without delete
        - declared variable hides function parameter
        - unsigned comparison with zero
        - dangerous/obsolete function asctime replaced with std::put_time

    ??? note
        Removed support in rbdock command for -t option without -C so -t now
        has a unique meaning. Previous meaning of -t without -C (filter file
        name) is provided via the newly added -f option. Now there is no need
        to distinguish during runtime which variant of -t has been requested,
        which simplifies the code and makes it more robust.

    ??? note
        EIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE define is required with the PGI C++ compiler, as
        otherwise the code doesn't compile due to a multiply defined function.

        More details are on the PGI User Forums topic "Error compiling with
        Eigen library": https://www.pgroup.com/userforum/viewtopic.php?t=6690

    ??? note
        Normally this should only be used for MSVC as MinGW provides dirent.h,
        but it turns out that the provided dirent.h is not sufficient for our
        usage.

    ??? note
        PCG fails to build on Solaris and Windows/MSVC. Use instead whatever the
        compiler and the standard library provide as the default C++11 RNG.

        Issues on GitHub:

        - Solaris: https://github.com/imneme/pcg-cpp/issues/42
        - Windows/MSVC: https://github.com/imneme/pcg-cpp/issues/11

- commit [`a17870831cd92307ee3f60354925f132996f7555`](https://gitlab.com/rxdock/rxdock/-/commit/a17870831cd92307ee3f60354925f132996f7555): Replaced custom Bjarne-inspired RNG with PCG

    ??? note
        PCG (pcg-random.org) is a family of simple fast space-efficient
        statistically good algorithms for random number generation. Unlike many
        general-purpose RNGs, they are also hard to predict.

        The C++ implementation follows the conventions of other C++11-style
        generators (WG21 N3551) and is available under the Apache License
        version 2.0.

    ??? note
        Changed 1E-10 to 1E-7, i.e. reduced by three orders of magnitude. 1E-4
        is used by default so 1E-7 is still finer than that.

        Unlike MSVC, GCC and Clang pass the tests with threshold down to 1E-14.

        MSVC doesn't export static member variables as symbols. Replaced access
        to these variables with getters returning a (const) reference.

    ??? note
        This solution is suboptimal as it polutes the source directory with the
        generated .as files, but it is still far more convenient than having to
        manually run rbcavity before running the tests.

    ??? note
        Cleaned up test checker Python script and made it compatible with
        Python 3, but decided not to use it because the results (that depend
        on a random number generator) weren't similar enough.

    ??? note
        Defined M_PI where needed, added include &lt;iterator&gt; and &lt;functional&gt;
        where they are missing, replaced static variable size array allocation
        with dynamic allocation, and avoided using macro names from winbase.h
        (and possibly others):
