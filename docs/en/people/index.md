    > Currently I'm employed at a Croatian software company as a Python Developer. Actually, I learned Python in one of Vedran's courses. For me, it was the first time I encountered a "fun" programming language that was so easy to write and so versatile. I obtained the experience needed while working as a student teaching assistant at the Department of Informatics at the University of Rijeka. This was an opportunity to catch a glimpse of what it means to be a professional educator; from the tedious grading of student home-works to the kick and energy you get in teaching a room full of students when a bunch of them come for the extra classes.
    >
    > Additionally, CNPSLab allowed me to experience the gusto of high-performance computing. What a joy it is to be able to say "Peasants, lo and behold! Thee not admireth my program speedeth? Denounce thy single-threaded, single-process and single-machine paradigms!". Of course, HPC comes with its own bag of implementation problems and challenges but I find it useful to have at least some experience in it. Overall, CNPSLab is concerned with a mixed bag of important topics in CS. If you decide to pursue any of these topics in your free time, just ask Vedran if you encounter any obstacles; he will be more than happy to share his experience and knowledge with any interested students.
    >
    > Finally, CNPSLab also kick-started my appreciation for the CLI. Sometimes it just feels so slender compared to cumber stone and ambiguous GUIs. Somehow related, probably the dearest (and most useless career-wise outside of academia) thing I encountered on Vedran's courses was LaTeX. No more missing references and bibliography entries, no more wonky margins and ugly equations, no more poorly mixed font types and font sizes, no more OS-specific formats and vendor lock-ins! It took years to hone my skills in LaTeX (and I'm still not close to being an expert), but it was worth it. You just can't replicate how clean and professional the final document looks.

    > I am employed as an HPC system administrator at Arctur, a privately owned HPC provider based in Slovenia. I mainly work on higher-level stuff, taking care of the resource manager, users, applications, and everything that goes with it. The other half of my time is spent working on several EU-funded projects where we are partners, like NextGenIO and Fortissimo. I also took the role of CEO at Yotta Advanced Computing, which is an HPC start-up from Croatia and has recently signed a partnership with Sugon, the biggest HPC vendor in China. Both companies take part in EU projects but mainly work with small and medium companies, helping them advance their products and services with HPC. Before stepping into the industry I studied Informatics at the Department of Informatics, the University of Rijeka where I got a Master's degree in Information and Communication Systems. During that time I worked as a student teaching and research assistant at CNPSLab, where I did research and provided technical support for other researchers. That is also where I first got into the world of high-performance computing, parallel applications, and simulations, which has had a significant impact on my career path. The lab also had a number of NVIDIA GPUs since it was a GPU Education Center, so I had a chance to get introduced to GPGPU computing and spend time working with CUDA.

    > I am a Technical Consulting Engineer at Cisco Systems, DNA/SDA Solution Support team in TAC organization. I joined Cisco in 2015 as a member of the LAN Switching team in the TAC organization. Prior to joining Cisco, I have worked as an associate network engineer in the Croatian Academic and Research Network.
    >
    > I am a big fan of Catalyst platforms and passionate about network engineering in general. My passion for networking dates back to the university years and Computer Networks classes given by Vedran Miletić.
    >
    > I hold the title of Master of Informatics and Bachelor of English language and literature, as well as CCIE R&S certificate.

    > I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Systems at the Department of Computing, Imperial College London. During my undergraduate studies at the University of Rijeka, I used to spend quite a bit of my days sticking around CNPSLab and bugging Vedran with topics on Linux, free and open-source software (FOSS), distributed systems, and Python. Vedran generously provided me with a hands-on opportunity to learn and engage in technologies that I was passionate about and kept ever-supporting me in giving my best. Working as an undergraduate minion in CNPSLab enabled me to be involved in teaching, system administration, and programming, and while providing a substantial technical and social experience, it served as great preparation for my further studies.
