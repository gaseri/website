title: Extending Non-Equilibrium Pulling Method in GROMACS with Arbitrary User-Defined Atom Weight Factor Expressions
description: Third Infinity 2022
keywords: non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation
abstract: |
  Numerous non-equilibrium methods are used in modern molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, non-equilibrium pulling can be used to simulate protein unfolding, ligand unbinding, and uniform flow as well as perform umbrella sampling. Recently, GRoningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS), a popular molecular dynamics simulation software package, introduced a transformation pull coordinate that allows arbitrary mathematical transformations of pull coordinates. This enables changing the pull direction, rate, and force during the simulation in a user-defined way. While these are generally useful, performing uniform flow simulation requires changing the force applied to the atoms of the pull group during the simulation. The extension of GROMACS we developed offers the ability to specify an arbitrary user-defined atom weight factor expression. This approach allows hard-coded smooth or non-smooth weighting of the pull group as a special case. This approach additionally allows the positions in $y$ and $z$ coordinates as well as the velocities in all three coordinates to affect weighting. The implementation is publicly available on GitLab and will be submitted for inclusion in a future version of GROMACS.

## Outline

- Molecular dynamics simulation
- Non-equilibrium pulling
- Uniform flow simulation
- Atom weight factor expression
- Applications

---

## Molecular dynamics simulation

- Simulation of physical movement of atoms and molecules
- Trajectories of atoms and molecules are obtained by solving Newton's equations of motion many times
    - Typical time step: 1-2 femtoseconds
    - Typical simulated time: nanoseconds to microseconds (10^6 to 10^9 steps)

## Non-equilibrium pulling

![Schematic picture of pulling a lipid out of a lipid bilayer with umbrella pulling. bg 120% right:45%](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/_images/pull.png)

- Applies external force to the molecular system
- Figure source: [Non-equilibrium pulling section](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/special/pulling.html) in the [GROMACS Reference Manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/)

---

## Pull coordinate

- Pull coordinate = distance, angle, or dihedral angle betwen centers of mass of two groups of atoms
    - Alternatively, one group can be replaced by a reference position in space
    - Combination of coordinates using (optionally time-dependent) expressions: transformation pull coordinate, e.g. `0.5*(x1 + x2)`

---

## Pull groups and force

- Pull group = a group of atoms weighted by their mass
    - Aditional per-atom weighting factor can be used
        - Defined in the simulation parameters, remains the same during simulation
- Constant force pulling applies constant force between the centers of mass of two groups

---

## Processes activated by flow

- Many biological processes occur under flow conditions, e.g.
    - Hemostasis to stop bleeding
    - Leukocyte adhesion at sites of inflammation
    - Spider silk spinning
- The biomolecules involved in the flow-dependent processes undergo specific conformational changes triggered (or influenced) by the flow

## Simulating uniform flow (1/3)

---

## Simulating uniform flow (2/3)

- Flow is a movement of solvent atoms
- Pulling all solvent atoms works when no other molecules except water are present in the simulation
- Just a slice of solvent molecules should be pulled to allow the solvent atoms to interact with the biomolecule(s) without being "dragged away"

---

## Simulating uniform flow (3/3)

---

## The previous approach (1/4)

- This approach is flow-specific
- Uses atom weighting factors in GROMACS to non-uniformly distribute the pulling force
    - Atoms of the solvent *inside* the slice -> weighting factor is *non-zero*
    - Atoms of the solvent *outside* the slice -> weighting factor is *zero*

---

## The previous approach (2/4)

- GROMACS limitation: weighting factors are defined once at the begining of the simulation
    - Problem: solvent atoms move during flow simulation, weighting factors should be recomputed each step
    - Solution: hack GROMACS to introduce the concept of the slice and recompute atom weighting factors each step

---

## The previous approach (3/4)

- Each atom is weighted with the weight factor:

    $$w_{sp} = x_{unit}^4 - 2x_{unit}^2 + 1$$

- Coordinate $x$ of each atom in the arbitrary slice is normalized from the interval $[s_{min}, s_{max}]$ to the coordinate $x_{unit}$ in the interval $[âˆ’1, 1]$:

    $$x_{unit} = \frac{x - \frac{s_{min} + s_{max}}{2}}{\frac{s_{min} - s_{max}}{2}}$$

## The previous approach (4/4)

---

## The new, general approach (1/3)

- Inspired by [transformation pull coordinates](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/special/pulling.html#the-transformation-pull-coordinate)
    - Uses the same [fast mathematical expression parser](https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/)
- Atom weight = dynamic weight factor computed from the expression **x** weight factor specified in the parameters file **x** atom mass-derived weight factor
- Dynamic weight factor (and atom weight) recomputed in each simulation step

---

## The new, general approach (2/3)

- Weight factor expression variables:
    - Atom position in 3D (`x`, `y`, `z`)
    - Atom velocity in 3D (`vx`, `vy`, `vz`)
- Examples:
    - Atom weight factor is sum of squares of positions: `x^2 + y^2 + z^2`
    - Atom weight factor is a linear combination of velocities: `1.75 * vx + 1.5 * vy + 1.25 * vz`

---

## The new, general approach (3/3)

- Covers the requirements of uniform flow simulation
- Non-smooth slice: `x >= 1 && x < 5 ? 1 : 0`
- Smooth slice: `x >= 1 && x < 5 ? (x - 2)^4 - 2 * (x - 2)^2 + 1 : 0`

---

## Possible applications of atom weight factor expressions

- Simulating uniform flow in arbitrary direction
- Pulling a protein domain with a non-uniform force applied to different residues
- Introducing external force in a subset of the periodic metal/material system
- Your ideas?

---

## Future plans

- Providing the option to configure the number of steps when weight factors are recomputed
- Adding heuristics that avoid recomputation of factors for atoms that did not move or accelerate *very much*
- Adding time as a variable in the expression
- More extensive testing and physical validation
- Inclusion in a future version of GROMACS (2024?)
