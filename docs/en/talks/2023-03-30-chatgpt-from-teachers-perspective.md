  Vedran Miletić is an assistant professor of computer science at Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies and the principal investigator of the Group for Applications and Services on Exascale Research Infrastructure. His group works on improving molecular dynamics simulation methods implemented in free and open-source software packages running on modern exascale supercomputers.
abstract: |
  ChatGPT has rocked the world of (higher) education and research like very few tools in the last decade. Many critics already consider it a development in technology that will result in wide societal changes comparable to the introduction of Google's web search and related products. The presentation will cover the impact of this tool from a teacher's perspective.

## Summary of news regarding ChatGPT over last 4 months

- ChatGPT is not an evolutionary technology development like mobile gaming or expansion in what's possible using web standards
- it is a revolutionary technology development, similar in significance to:
    - the Internet
    - Google Search
        - no more website categories like Yahoo! Directory required
    - social networks
    - iPhone (and smartphones in general)
- ChatGPT changes how information is retrieved by the user, challenges web search far more than social networks ever did
- started the era of mainstream everyday usage of AI tools

## Gradual or instant change?

- similar example from the past: desktop to web transition
    - 1997\. (the pre-Google era) Microsoft Windows is the *de facto* standard, desktop applications dominate software for PCs
    - 2007\. (the Google era) Paul Graham says [Microsoft is Dead](http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html):

        > Microsoft's biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they suck. They still think they can write software in house. Maybe they can, by the standards of the desktop world. But that world ended a few years ago.

    - it took roughtly a decade; far from an instant change

- similarly, ChatGPT has motivated the **gradual** introduction of AI-powered technologies into existing tools

## Is OpenAI the new Google?

- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) was [founded in 2015](https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-openai-company-chatgpt-elon-musk-founded-2022-12) by [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/) and [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk); [charter](https://openai.com/charter):

    > OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome.

## Impact on teaching

- initial resistance, as usual with new technologies
    - [How ChatGPT could make it easy to cheat on written tests and homework: 'You can NO LONGER give take-home exams or homework'](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-11513127/ChatGPT-OpenAI-cheat-tests-homework.html)
    - [ChatGPT appears to pass medical school exams. Educators are now rethinking assessments](https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2023-01-12/chatgpt-generative-ai-program-passes-us-medical-licensing-exams/101840938)
- ChatGPT can grade student solutions to exercies (given the criteria), asses student essays, guide students in improving their writing etc.
    - [teaching is among the top 10 jobs likely to be replaced by AI](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-jobs-at-risk-replacement-artificial-intelligence-ai-labor-trends-2023-02)
- its style of writing is presently recognizable (and therefore hard to hide if the student is lazy), it might not be that way  in the future
- Croatia-specific: Croatian language model is not as good as English

## Impact on research: Nature

[Tools such as ChatGPT threaten transparent science; here are our ground rules for their use](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00191-1):

> First, no LLM tool will be accepted as a credited author on a research paper. That is because any attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, and AI tools cannot take such responsibility.  
> Second, researchers using LLM tools should document this use in the methods or acknowledgements sections. If a paper does not include these sections, the introduction or another appropriate section can be used to document the use of the LLM.

---

## Impact on research: Science

[Science Journals: Editorial Policies](https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies):

> (...) artificial intelligence tools cannot be authors. (...)  
> Artificial intelligence (AI) policy: Text generated from AI, machine learning, or similar algorithmic tools cannot be used in papers published in Science journals, nor can the accompanying figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools, without explicit permission from the editors. In addition, an AI program cannot be an author of a Science journal paper. A violation of this policy constitutes scientific misconduct.

## Future outlook

- [GPT-3 -> GPT-4](https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-new-chatgpt-what-you-get-with-gpt-4-vs-gpt-35) transition
    - already a part of [a released product](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) called ChatGPT+
    - [used by Bing](https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4)
- non-English language models likely to improve soon
    - within months, maybe a year or two
    - remember how well Google Translate performed 10 years ago and compare that to how it performs now
- make sure to visit [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/) and try it
