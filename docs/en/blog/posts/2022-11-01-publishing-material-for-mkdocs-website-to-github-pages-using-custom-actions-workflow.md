As you can probably see, this website is built using [the Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), which we have been [happily using](2021-08-16-markdown-vs-restructuredtext-for-teaching-materials.md) for over one year after [using Sphinx](2017-07-29-why-we-use-restructuredtext-and-sphinx-static-site-generator-for-maintaining-teaching-materials.md) for many years prior to that. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) offers [built-in support for Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), but not for MkDocs and therefore it requires the manual building and deployment of our website. However, it automates many other things, including [HTTPS certificate provisioning on our domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https) via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

There are [several somewhat](https://bluegenes.github.io/mkdocs-github-actions/) [related approaches](https://github.com/Tiryoh/actions-mkdocs) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for [automating the deployment](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-mkdocs) of MkDocs-generated sites, usually with the Material theme, to GitHub Pages. These guides are not only found on blogs written by enthusiasts; the official [Getting started section](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) of the Material for MkDocs documentation describes the usage of GitHub Actions for deployment and [provides a generic YAML file for that purpose](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/#with-github-actions).

Using the approaches mentioned above avoids the requirement to run the `build` and `gh-deploy` steps locally; GitHub Actions does both on GitHub's [CI/CD](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/) servers, where [the free plan](https://github.com/pricing) offers [2000 minutes of GitHub-hosted runners per month](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes). As many sites build in less than a minute, this amount allows from 50 to 100 builds and deployments *per day*, which is quite a bit more than most sites require. Additionally, the repository layout remains the same as it would be if the build and deployment steps were done locally; the `main` branch contains the site source in Markdown and the `gh-pages` branch contains the site files that get built for serving.

Since this summer, GitHub offers [publishing Pages using a custom Actions workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) as [a public beta](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-07-27-github-pages-custom-github-actions-workflows-beta/), which was a unique feature of [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/pages/) for years. I thought that it would be interesting to see if we could use the existing GitHub Actions workflow configuration for Jekyll and simply replace the Jekyll build step with the MkDocs build step. This would streamline the usage of MkDocs with GitHub Pages, and, in particular, eliminate the requirement for publishing the site from a separate `gh-pages` branch, offering a Jekyll-like experience.

Let's see how far we can get. Without going into details about [the syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions), here is [the starter workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) [configuration file](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/jekyll-gh-pages.yml) for deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages:

``` yaml hl_lines="1-2 7 33-37"
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy Jekyll with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: [$default-branch]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build with Jekyll
        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
        with:
          source: ./
          destination: ./_site
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

The highlighted lines are Jekyll-specific. We can easily replace these lines with:

- the Python setup Action,
- the installation, using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) and the `requirements.txt` file, of
    - MkDocs with [extra internationalization support](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/localizing-your-theme/#installation),
    - [the Material for MkDocs framework](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/#installation),
    - the optional dependencies required for [the generation of social cards](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/), that is, [CairoSVG](https://cairosvg.org/), which will pull [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) as a dependency, and, finally,
- the MkDocs site build command.

In this case, since we want a drop-in replacement for Jekyll so that the remaining commands work perfectly, we will perform the MkDocs build using the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file in the current directory and write the built site output files into the `_site` directory.

The `.github/workflows/mkdocs-gh-pages.yml` file will look like:

``` yaml hl_lines="1-2 7 33-52"
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a MkDocs site to GitHub Pages
name: Deploy MkDocs with GitHub Pages dependencies preinstalled

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install yamllint
        run: pip install yamllint
      - name: Check MkDocs YAML configuration
        run: yamllint ./mkdocs.yml
        continue-on-error: true
      - name: Check Markdown files
        uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v19
        with:
          globs: '**/*.md'
        continue-on-error: true
      - name: Install required packages
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Build site (_site directory name is used for Jekyll compatiblity)
        run: mkdocs build --config-file ./mkdocs.yml --strict --site-dir ./_site
        env:
          CI: true
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Two linters are used:

- for `mkdocs.yml`, [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) configuration is in the `.yamllint.yaml` file. It should reside in the root of the repository and contain the following:

    ``` yaml
    extends: default

    rules:
      document-end:
        present: false
      document-start:
        present: false
      line-length:
        level: warning
        allow-non-breakable-inline-mappings: true
    ```

- for Markdown files, [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) configuration is in the `.markdownlint.json` file. It should also reside in the root of the repository and contain the following:

    ``` json
    {
      "default": true,
      "MD007": { "indent": 4 }
    }
    ```

Finally, we can see the mention of the `requirements.txt` file. You guessed it, it should reside in the root of the repository as well. It should contain the following text:

``` text
mkdocs-material[recommended,imaging]
```

And that's it! There is no more requirement for the `.nojekyll` file as Jekyll never gets ran in the build process. There is also no more separate `gh-pages` branch that the built files get pushed to, so there is also no more worry whether the site builds over time will add up to [the 1 GB soft limit](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#repository-size-limits).

Finally, if you want to use a custom domain, having the `CNAME` file in the repository root or the `docs` subfolder will no longer have the desired effect; the domain has to be [configured through the repository settings or using the API](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#creating-a-custom-github-actions-workflow-to-publish-your-site).

**Updated on 2022-11-25:** changed Python version from 3.10 to 3.11, resulting in faster docs builds (see [Faster CPython](https://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython) for details).

**Updated on 2022-12-03:** changed caching to use `github.sha` instead of `github.ref`, enabling rebuilds of social cards when site contents change.

**Updated on 2023-06-06:** rebased our additions on top of [the latest version](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/jekyll-gh-pages.yml) of `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` from [Starter Workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows). Changed Python version from 3.11 to [the latest stable 3.x](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-input), which is 3.11 at the moment. However, using the current beta version of [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/whatsnew/3.12.html) already works well with `mkdocs-material`, so it's unlikely to cause issues even when 3.12 gets released and becomes the latest stable version.

**Updated on 2023-09-08:** simplified the workflow to use the existing `requirements.txt` file instead of duplicating the package names in the `pip` command run.

**Updated on 2023-10-24:** updated `requirements.txt` to use [the extras](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#extras) for the installation of [the optional dependencies](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/requirements/image-processing/#dependencies).

**Updated on 2023-12-28:** bumped [Actions](https://github.com/actions) versions by rebasing our additions on top of [the latest version](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/pages/jekyll-gh-pages.yml) of `jekyll-gh-pages.yml` from [Starter Workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows).

**Updated on 2024-05-12:** added [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) and [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) steps. Removed caching as (Material for) MkDocs version is not pinned and therefore the site builds are not reproducible.
