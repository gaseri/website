Our everyday [scientific](../../projects/index.md) and [educational](../../teaching/index.md) work relies heavily on hardware, software, and, in modern times, cloud services. The equipment that we will mention below is specific to our group; common services used by university and/or faculty employees will not be specifically mentioned here.
