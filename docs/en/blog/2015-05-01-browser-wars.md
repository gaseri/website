# Browser wars

Last week in Rijeka we held [Science festival 2015](https://www.mojarijeka.hr/otvoren-13-festival-znanosti-s-temom-sunce/). This is the (hopefully not unlucky) 13th instance of the festival that started in 2003. Popular science events were organized in 18 cities in Croatia.

I was invited to give a popular lecture at the [University departments open day](https://www.math.uniri.hr/hr/component/content/article/13-hr/novosti/404-otvornei-dan-2015.html), which is a part of the festival. This is the second time in a row that I got invited to give popular lecture at the open day. In 2014 I talked about The Perfect Storm in information technology caused by the fall of economy during [2008-2012 Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession) and the simultaneous rise of low-cost, high-value open-source solutions. Open source completely changed the landscape of information technology in just a few years.

The talk was well received, but unfortunately was not recorded. However, I was invited to repeat it at [Rikon](https://www.rikonrijeka.com/) 2014, and we have the [recording from there posted on YouTube](https://youtu.be/EE2cZSeqB3k). The recording is in Croatian, but the [Truth Happens Remix video](https://youtu.be/5EkkMfjetEY) I play during the talk is in English. I also have to credit [Jim Whitehurst's TEDx talk on Economics of the Information Revolution](https://youtu.be/6ag8DiOWG1I) for inspiration.

## University departments open day 2015

This year I wanted to talk more specifically about why open source succeeded, and ideally cover one successful project the general public had prior experience with in the role of a user. Completely unrelated, I also really wanted to talk at some point about what I saw during [the early years of Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/about/history/). These two were easy to combine, and the topic of **Browser wars** was proposed and accepted.

The talk covered the rise of NCSA [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29), rise of [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) [Navigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator)/[Communicator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator) and later Microsoft [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer), [the First browser war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars#First_browser_war) between the two, the fall of Netscape and appearance of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/). I stressed the importance of [web standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/), and explained how they allowed Apple and Google to enter the competition with Safari and Chrome. Mozilla did not just make the entrance easier for them; it made the entrance possible at all. Mozilla did that by pushing its standards-compliant Firefox browser to the mainstream, which in turn forced webmasters to [adapt](https://validator.w3.org/).

There is an interesting image on Wikimedia Commons that shows [browser market share over time, from 1996 to 2009](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Browser_Wars_%28en%29.svg). This timeframe only shows Mozilla Firefox biting into Internet Explorer's market share, so Google Chrome is not shown.

The talk has been recorded and will be^W^W [has been uploaded to YouTube](https://youtu.be/pz73gD1H-s4) as soon as I get a hold of the recording. In the meantime, you can take a look at the [2012 version of the epic Mozilla Story video](https://youtu.be/Q1n2q_YSZUE) I played during the talk (for die-hard fans of Mozilla I will note that 2011 version is also [available](https://youtu.be/tDDVAErOI5U)).

## Article in the Universitas newspaper

University of Split newspaper [Universitas](https://www.unist.hr/sveucilisni-list-universitas) published an article covering the talk in [issue 65](https://www.unist.hr/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/API/Entries/Download?language=hr-HR&EntryId=660&Command=Core_Download&PortalId=0&TabId=1569), pages 18 and 19. Tomislav Čizmić Marović helped me get the article in shape for publication, had no problem accepting drafts in [OpenDocument format](https://opendocumentformat.org/), and handled the typesetting very professionally. Thanks!
